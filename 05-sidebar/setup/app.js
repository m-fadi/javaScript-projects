// We're creating a web shop selling hummus (or chocolate, or eba and egusi soup)!

// Create a number input field in HTML that lets the user choose the amount of hummus:

// Choose the amount of hummus servings:
// <input type="number" id="amount" min="0" value="0" oninput="amountChanged()">
// Use the valueAsNumber property of the number input to get the amount that the user selected in your amountChanged function. Output the total price the user has to pay to a div element.

// Extend your webshop to sell two products (e.g. hummus and chocolate).

// Every product has a different price. Update the total price in the div element every time the user changes the amount of hummus and chocolate.
